## OpenCV
For now, I'm thinking we could use [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) to do the video processing. Here's a [tutorial](https://solarianprogrammer.com/2015/06/04/opencv-video-editing-tutorial/) I found
for it.

## Other Resources
This [video-to-ascii](https://github.com/joelibaceta/video-to-ascii) repo share a similar premise/strategy. They converted each frame of the video to ascii.  
This [article](https://www.veed.io/blog/how-to-build-a-video-editor/) detailed how veed.io created their online video editor. Since our project is way smaller in scope, we shouldn't encounter a lot of the issues they faced.
